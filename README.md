Recursion is Great, But ...
===========================

This repository is for the “Recursion is Great, But ...”
lesson in my book, [Learning Functional Programming in 
Scala](https://alvinalexander.com/scala/learning-functional-programming-in-scala-book).


## Source code

The source code for the last two objects in this lesson are in the
*src/main/scala/folding* folder. The remainder of the source code
consists of the following “source code snippets.” The snippets of
code are listed in the order in which they are presented in the 
lesson.

    def sum(list: List[Int]): Int = list match {
        case Nil => 0

    }

        case Nil => 1
        case x :: xs => x * product(xs)
